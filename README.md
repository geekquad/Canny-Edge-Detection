# Canny-Edge-Detection
The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. It accepts a gray scale image as input and it uses a multistage algorithm.
<p> <h3> Canny -Edge Detection mainly runs in 5 sequential steps: </h3> </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Smoothing </li>
  <li> Finding Gradients </li>
  <li> Non-maximum suppression </li>
  <li> Hystersis Thresholding </li> 
  </ul> </p>
<p> <h3> Result: </h3> </p>
